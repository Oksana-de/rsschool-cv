## **About me**
I am a junior web developer, constantly improving in front-end technologies on my way to a career change after 14 years in corporate banking.\
My previous work experience is not related to IT, but gave me unique experience in the field of decision making, project management and financial analytics and helped me develop analytical thinking skills, detail-oriented thinking, communication skills, the ability to quickly respond to changing external conditions and understanding the importance of lifelong learning.\
I believe that banking best practices, self-organization, hard work and attention to detail can be a good foundation for success in **IT**, including **Front-end development**.
